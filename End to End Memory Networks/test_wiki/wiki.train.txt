The inhabitants at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the late 18th century were a local band of the Ohlone tribe.
 The peninsula became part of the vast Rancho San Antonio granted in 1820 to Luis Peralta by the Spanish king who claimed California.
 The grant was later confirmed by the new Republic of Mexico upon its independence from Spain.
Over time, the place became known as Bolsa de Encinal or Encinal de San Antonio.
The city was founded on June 6, 1853, and the town originally contained three small settlements.
 "Alameda" referred to the village at Encinal and High Streets, Hibbardsville was at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and Woodstock was on the west near the ferry piers of the South Pacific Coast Railroad and the Central Pacific.
 Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the Alameda Mole, featuring transit connections between San Francisco ferries, local trollies and Southern Pacific (formerly Central Pacific) commuter lines.
The first post office opened in 1854.
 The first school, Schmermerhorn School, was opened in 1855 (and eventually became Lincoln School), Encinal School was opened in 1860 (and closed in 1980).
 The San Francisco and Alameda Railroad opened the Encinal station in 1864.
 The Encinal area was also known as Fasskings Station in honor of Frederick Louis Fassking.
 Encinal's own post office opened in 1876, was renamed West End in 1877, and closed in 1891.
 The West End area was originally called Bowman's Point in honor of Charles G. Bowman, an early settler.
The Alameda Terminal was the site of the arrival of the first train via the First Transcontinental Railroad into the San Francisco Bay Area on September 6, 1869.
 The transcontinental terminus was switched to the Oakland Mole two months later, on November 8, 1869.
The borders of Alameda were made coextensive with the island in 1872, incorporating Woodstock into Alameda.
In 1917, an attraction called Neptune Beach was built in the area now known as Crab Cove.
 Often compared to Coney Island, the park was a major attraction in the 1920s and 1930s.
 The original owners of the facility, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create tastes unique to Neptune Beach.
 Both the American snow cone and the popsicle were first sold at Neptune Beach.
 The Kewpie doll, hand-painted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games at the beach&nbsp; another Neptune Beach invention.
 The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own, even filling in a section of the bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and an exceptional roller coaster which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay.
 The Cottage Baths were available for rent.
Neptune Beach's two huge outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian Johnny Weismuller, who later starred as the original Tarzan, and Jack LaLanne, who started a chain of health clubs.
 The park closed down in 1939 because of the Great Depression, the completion of the San FranciscoOakland Bay Bridge, people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture.
 Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves.
 People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California.
 Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists.
 Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park.
 Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.
Some of the resort homes and buildings from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda.
 The Croll Building, on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914.
 James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here.
 Today this beautiful preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant.
 Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort life was like in Alameda in the 1920s.
 A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.
The vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures&nbsp; the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the Ferris wheel, the roller coaster, and other rides&nbsp; were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost.
 Today,  A consequence of the Neptune Beach closing around 1940 was a total dearth of quality, clean swimming facilities in town.
 A grass roots effort to create swimming pools at two high schools and two city parks would continue into the early 1960s.
When the railroad came to town in the 1860s Park Street developed into the major thoroughfare of the city and the location of the main Alameda train station, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown.
 The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land.
 As a result, they designated their mutual property line as Park Street.
In 1902, the need for expanded shipping facilities led to the dredging of a canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda, turning Alameda into an island.
 Most of the soil from the canal was used to fill in nearby marshland.
 The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland.
 In his youth, author Jack London was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone.
 The Alameda Works Shipyard was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country.
 In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the Alameda Estuary, where the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane was used.
 Today,  the Port of Oakland across the estuary serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast, using the shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda.
 As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a "Coast Guard City", one of seven in the country.
In addition to the regular trains running to the Alameda Mole, Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific) which were later transformed into the East Bay Electric Lines.
 Southern Pacific's electrified trains were not streetcars, but full-sized railroad cars which connected to the mainland by bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today).
 The trains ran to both the Oakland Mole and the Alameda Mole.
 In fact, one line which ran between the two moles was dubbed the "Horseshoe Line" for the shape of the route on a map.
 Soon after the completion of the Bay Bridge, Alameda trains ran directly to San Francisco on the lower deck of the bridge, the ferries having been rendered unnecessary.
 Alameda was the site of the Southern Pacific's West Alameda Shops where all the electric trains were maintained and repaired.
In the 1930s Pan American Airways established a seaplane port along the fill that led to the Alameda Mole.
 This was the original home base for the famous China Clipper flying boat.

In 1929, the University of California established the San Francisco Airdrome located near the current Webster Street tube as a public airport.
 The Bay Airdrome had its gala christening party in 1930.
 The airfield was a busy place, as an early home base for Coastal Air Freight, Varney Air Lines, West Coast Air Transport, Western Air Express, the transbay Air Ferries, and Boeing's Pacific Air Transport.
 The Airdrome was closed in 1941 when its air traffic interfered with the newly built Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS Alameda).
 With the advent of World War II, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the NAS Alameda established.
 This major Naval facility included a large airfield, as well as docks for several aircraft carriers.
 It closed in 1997.
In the late 1950s the Utah Construction Company began a landfill beyond the Old Sea Wall and created South Shore.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  (53.79%) is water.
Although Alameda's nickname is "The Island City" (or simply "the island"), the current city occupies two islands as well as a small section of the mainland.
 Today, the city consists of the main original section, with the former Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS Alameda) at the west end of Alameda Island, Southshore along the southern side of Alameda Island, and Bay Farm Island, which is part of the mainland proper.
 The area of the former NAS is now known as "Alameda Point."
 The Southshore area is separated from the main part of Alameda Island by a lagoon; the north shore of the lagoon is located approximately where the original south shore of the island was.
 Alameda Point and Southshore are built on bay fill.
Not all of Alameda Island is part of the City of Alameda.
 Although nearly all of the island is in Alameda city limits, a small portion of a dump site west of the former runways at Alameda Point extends far enough into San Francisco Bay that it is over the county line and part of the City and County of San Francisco.
Coast Guard Island, a small island between Alameda Island and Oakland, is also part of Alameda and is the home of Integrated Support Command Alameda
