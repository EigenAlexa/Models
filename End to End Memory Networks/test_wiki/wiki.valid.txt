A similar confusion occurs in Gospel of Mark 2:26:
When his father and the priests of Nob were slain on the command of Saul, Abiathar escaped, bearing with him the ephod.
 Rabbinical literature that linked the later extermination of the male descendants of David with the priests of Nob, also link the survival of David's descendant Joash with that of Abiathar.
 (Sanh.
 95b)
Abiathar joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam (1 Sam.
 22:20-23; 23:6).
 He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam.
 30:7).
 When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed High Priest (1 Chr.
 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the "king's counselor" (1 Chr.
 27:33-34).
 Meanwhile, Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made High Priest.
 According to the Jewish Encyclopedia Abiathar was deposed from office when he was deserted by the Holy Spirit without which the Urim and Thummin could not be consulted.
 Another version says he was Co-Pontiff with Zadok during King David.
 He supported Prince Adonijah over Prince Solomon, and was deposed by him and exiled in Anathoth.
These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (1 Kings 4:4).
 Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne.
 The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (1 Sam.
 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27).
 Zadok now became sole high priest.
 Abiathar's removal from the Priesthood fulfilled that other part of the curse on the House of Elithat the Priesthood would pass out of the House of Eli.
In Georgian traditions, Abiathar and Sidonia were a legendary Jewish priest of Mtskheta and his daughter.
 Abiathar is said to have been the first person Saint Nino converted to Christianity.
"Abiathar" (pronounced  "Abiathar" (A·bia·thar) in Modern Hebrew) is sometimes used a male given name in contemporary Israel (see Eviatar Banai, Eviatar Zerubavel, Eviatar Manor).
